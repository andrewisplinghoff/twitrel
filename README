twitrel is a simple twitter client based on Ruby on Rails.
It sorts the timeline of your friends' tweets not only based on
when the tweets have been crated, but also takes into account how
many tweets your friends are sending. Friends who don't write much
are ranked higher so you can keep up with them without having to
watch your timeline all the time.

============
   Setup
============
You will need to have Ruby on Rails installed on your client.
Insert your user name and password into config/environment.rb so
that twitrel is able to fetch your friends' timeline (this function
in the Twitter API needs authentication because some of your friends
might have protected their updates).

Run the application in a webrick server with

# script/server

. If you want to have twitrel running on your system while also
running other webrick servers, you can specify a specific port that
webrick should run on with 'script/server -p [port]'.
Put '/path/to/twitrel/script/server -p [port] &' into some autostart
script if you want to have it always running.

You can use the application from your browser using http://localhost:port.
If you don't specify a specific port, it defaults to 3000.

I use twitrel like a normal application with a link from the desktop
using Mozilla Prism. If you want to do this, you will need to install Prism
as a browser plugin from Firefox. Then, visit the twitrel website in your 
browser and click Tools -> "Convert Website to Application".
